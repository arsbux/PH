### Chart Styling Applied to All

**Line Styling:**
- ✅ `type="natural"` for smooth, organic curves (like Google Trends)
- ✅ `strokeWidth={3}` for better visibility (up from 2px)
- ✅ `dot={false}` - no static dots for cleaner lines
- ✅ `activeDot={{ r: 6 }}` - interactive dots only on hover

**Grid & Axes:**
- ✅ Subtle grid with lighter color (`#e5e7eb`) and opacity (0.5)
- ✅ Lightened axis colors to `#9ca3af`
- ✅ Reduced font size to 12px
- ✅ Removed tick lines (`tickLine={false}`)
- ✅ Enhanced tooltips with subtle shadows

### Visual Improvements

**Before:**
- Straight-ish lines with visible connection points
- Dots on every data point (cluttered)
- Thinner lines (harder to distinguish)
- Heavier grid and axes

**After:**
- Smooth, natural curves that flow organically
- Clean lines without dots (dots only on hover)
- Thicker, more visible trend lines
- Subtle, minimal grid and axes
- Matches Google Trends aesthetic

### Curve Types Explained

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `linear` | Straight lines between points | Raw, unsmoothed data |
| `monotone` | Smooth curves that maintain data monotonicity | Safe smoothing |
| **`natural`** | **Smooth spline curves like Google Trends** | **Best visual appeal** |
| `step` | Step-like transitions | Discrete states |

We chose `natural` for the most visually appealing, Google Trends-style curves.

### Color Palette (Maintained)

The vibrant color scheme remains:
```javascript
const topicColors = [
  '#3b82f6', // Blue
  '#8b5cf6', // Purple
  '#f97316', // Orange
  '#10b981', // Green
  '#ec4899'  // Pink
];
```

### Examples

**Topic Velocity Chart:**
- Shows 5 trending categories with smooth curves
- Clean, minimal styling
- Interactive hover states
- Professional, data-journalism quality

### Performance Notes

- `natural` curves are computed client-side but have negligible performance impact
- Removing static dots reduces SVG elements by ~50-100 per chart
- Overall rendering is faster and smoother

### Accessibility

- Maintained high contrast colors for readability
- Thicker lines (3px) improve visibility
- Interactive hover states work with assistive tech
- Tooltips remain fully accessible
